# ReadingJourney
## Description
ReadingJourney is a kidsâ€™ app that allows users to track their daily reading habits and rewards consistent daily reading. 

Users can:
* Log the books they read and the time spent reading them;
* Earn a ticket for every minute they read, which can be redeemed for other rewards or activities;
* Attain progressively higher ranks based on the total minutes they have read; and
* Earn medals for each three-, five-, or seven-day reading streak.
